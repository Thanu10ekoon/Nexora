## 🎯 Testing Guide for Campus Copilot Chatbot

### ✅ Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Intent Planning Fix**: Added 'greeting' and 'casual' cases to `planActions()` method
2. **Failure Check Fix**: Excluded greeting/casual intents from API failure validation
3. **Pattern Matching**: Improved word boundary matching for short patterns
4. **Intent Scoring**: Fixed edge cases in intent scoring logic

### 🧪 Test Cases to Try:

#### Basic Greetings (Should work now!)
- "hi" → Should get personalized greeting
- "hello" → Should get welcome message with features
- "hey" → Should get friendly response
- "good morning" → Should get time-based greeting

#### Casual Conversations
- "how are you" → Should get friendly response
- "what can you do" → Should list capabilities
- "who are you" → Should introduce itself
- "help me" → Should offer assistance

#### Campus Queries  
- "what's my schedule today" → Should get class schedule
- "what's for lunch" → Should get menu items
- "bus timings" → Should get bus schedules
- "upcoming events" → Should get event list

#### Quick Actions (Use buttons)
- 📅 Today's schedule
- 🍽️ Menu for today  
- 🚌 Bus timings
- 📢 Upcoming events

### 🔧 Expected Behavior:
- Greetings should now work without the "trouble accessing information" error
- Responses should be natural and contextual
- Intent confidence should be displayed for debugging
- Mock data should be used seamlessly when API is unavailable
